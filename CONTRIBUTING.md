## üé® Adding New Icons

1. Firstly crop the SVG icon you want to add using [SVGCrop.com](https://svgcrop.com/) to ensure that there is no unnecessary space around the icon
2. Place your SVG files in the `/icons/raw` directory and rename them in a consistent way according to other pre-existing icons
3. Run the optimization script which automatically moves the icons from `/icons/raw` folder to `/icons` folder after optimization:
   ```bash
   npm run optimize-svgs
   ```
4. Update the icons data for every icon in the `/lib/iconsData.ts` file in a consistent way according to rest of the data and arrange them in alphabetical order
5. Build the project to generate the new icon components:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
6. Run the playground environment to add and test the newly added/changed icon components
   ```bash
   npm run dev:playground
   ```
7. If everything looks good, push the changes and create a Pull Request
